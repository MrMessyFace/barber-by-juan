        My name is Juan. I moved from Nebraska to Texas with the dream of
        opening a new barbershop in a new state after having my own back in
        Nebraska. At first, I was working at many different barbershops in the
        area but couldn't find work to support myself. Until one day, I stopped
        to think and God led me to this place. To try my dream one more time and
        start this journey of owning my second barbershop. What I love most of
        all is not just cutting hair but the connection I get to have with new
        people. To be able to create a whole new family in this amazing
        community at the same time.
