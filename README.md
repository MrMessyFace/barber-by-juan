# Barber by Juan

## Description

I created a website for the Barber by Juan Barber Shop, a business located in Garland, Texas, in React. It has a home page with the shop's main logo, a slideshow containing gallery images, the location and phone number, a map of the gps location, and the hours of operation, an about page, a services page, and a gallery page. The navbar has working links to each page, a book now button that takes you to their booking app account, and a link to their Instagram page. In the footer, there is a link to my portfolio. Additionally, I used basic CSS, Font Awesome icons, and the React-Player npm package.

## Installation

No installation necessary but you can clone the [repository](https://github.com/MrMessyFace/barber-by-juan) from GitHub to edit and make your own version.

## Usage

When a user loads the page, they are able to see a working navbar that has a logo as the home button, links to each page, a book now button for booking appointments, and a link to their Instagram page. Below the navbar is the main logo, a slideshow containing gallery images, the address and phone numbers, an image containing the gps map, and the hours of operation. On the about page, there is a picture of the owner and his personal bio. On the services page, there is a list of the services they provide. On the gallery page, there is a section for photos and a section for videos. Then there is a footer with the owner's copyright and my signature containing a link to my portfolio page.
